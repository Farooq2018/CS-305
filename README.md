# Project Summary
Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers.
The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They wanted to modernize their operations and security plays a crucial role
in their custom application. They reached out to us to seek expertise on how to protect their vital data from external threats.
When I ran the dependency-check report and found several vulnerabilities, I patched the code wherever necessary and make sure there is no security loopholes
in the application. It is important to code securely because it assures you that your application won't penetatrable and user can rest assure their data is safe and
secure. Software security brings assurance and protection to a company's overall wellbeing. The challenging part was new vulnerabilities appearing out of nowhere.
I increase the layers of security by refactoring the code, especially making class and method field private. OWASP security tool was very helpful when finding 
vulnerabilities in the application and their mitigations was found in the dependency-check report as well. It makes our life much easier to mitigate these 
vulnerabilities. I have learned a lot from this project especially assessing the components of software and finding security loopholes.
